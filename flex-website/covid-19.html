      <h1>Information for Students:-</h1>
      <h3>Introduction & Purpose

        <p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced our life and living to a great
          extent, the evolving situation has forced our way of working by adding
          new dimension to the concept of learning and teaching. This is a
          significant challenge and the reality is we need to create and adopt a safe
          working environment and working style within our institute community.</p>

          <p>We understand the fact that life in the hostel and academic premises is
            our Living space and a social platform for interaction faculties,
            classmates, friends and external visitors with exchange of documents,
            ideas and materials which are potential source and medium of infection.
            It is also realized that we as individuals need to be healthy and awareness
            on health hazard and risk elements are necessary for ensuring a healthy
            environment and be more productive to achieve our goals and targets.
            </p>
